# BukkitAlerts
Looks at Bukkit with a beady eye and routes the information back to you in the form of a 'ping'

**How?**
Provide your account details and delay in details.json, then start the application. The application will log in to Bukkit and check for alerts every x seconds, delay dependant. If the application sees that your account has an alert then it will 'ping' you with an inintrusive audio clip, it'll ping you again to remind you after another iteration of your personlised delay.

**Oh no my Bukkit icon has a cross on it!**
This happens when the application has an error, check error.txt for a list of any errors, if you can't figure it out yourself then post an issue and I'll get back to you.
